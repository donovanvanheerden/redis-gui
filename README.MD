# Redis GUI

![Builds](https://github.com/donovanvanheerden/redsmith/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)


This Redis GUI currently only supports string values. This was initially developed as a replacement for an "old" Redis GUI (Redily), as the UI/UX for that was something I loved and wanted to re-create for the same experience.
